I'm a pre-doctoral fellow at Yale University working with Prof. Alan S. Gerber and Prof. Gregory H. Huber on behavioral research in American politics. I'm broadly interested in voting, public opinion, and (quasi-)experimental methods. I'm affiliated with the <a href="https://isps.yale.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institution for Social and Policy Studies</a>, the <a href="https://csap.yale.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for the Study of American Politics</a>, and the <a href="https://tobin.yale.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tobin Center for Economic Policy</a>. 

I received my B.A. in political science and art history, *cum laude*, from Columbia University in 2024. At Columbia, I researched voting with Prof. Donald P. Green, polarization with Prof. Justin H. Phillips, and bureaucratic politics and separation of powers with Prof. Michael M. Ting.
