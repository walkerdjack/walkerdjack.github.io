I'm a pre-doctoral fellow at Yale University working with Prof. Alan S. Gerber and Prof. Gregory H. Huber. I'm interested in voting, public opinion, and quasi-experimental methods. I'm affiliated with the <a href="https://isps.yale.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institution for Social and Policy Studies</a>, the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu), and the [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu). 

I received my B.A. in political science and art history, *cum laude*, from Columbia University in 2024. At Columbia, I researched voting with Prof. Donald P. Green, polarization with Prof. Justin H. Phillips, and bureaucratic politics with Prof. Michael M. Ting.
