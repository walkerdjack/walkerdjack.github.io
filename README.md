I'm a pre-doctoral fellow at Yale University. I'm interested in voting, public opinion, and quasi-experimental methods. I'm affiliated with the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu), the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu), and the [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu). 

I received my B.A. in political science and art history, *cum laude*, from Columbia University in 2024. My research at Columbia concerned voting, polarization, and separation of powers.
